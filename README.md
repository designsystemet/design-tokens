# Designsystemet Design Tokens

This is a repository that will autogenerate design tokens when the config file is updated.

## How to use

1. "Use this template" to create your own repository.
2. Update the `designsystemet.config.json` file with your theme from [theme.designsystemet.no](https://theme.designsystemet.no).
   - You can do this directly in github by clicking the pencil icon when viewing the file.
3. Commit your changes.

## Considerations
